# **MMLU**

## Task Description

Original **Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)** translated into Russian. This dataset is designed to measure model professional knowledge acquired during pretraining in various fields. The task covers 57 subjects (subdomains) across different topics (domains): HUMANITIES; SOCIAL SCIENCE; SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS (STEM); OTHER. The dataset was translated into Russian from original MMLU dataset proposed in [1] and presented in instruction format. Each example contains a question from one of the categories with four possible answers, only one of which is correct.

**Warning:** results on the MMLU and ruMMLU datasets cannot be directly compared with each other.

**Warning:** This is a diagnostic dataset with an open test and is not used for general model evaluation on the benchmark. Open data is the public test set of the original ruHumanEval dataset. Do not use it in train purposes!

**Keywords**: logic, world knowledge, factual, expert knowledge

### Motivation

This set is a continuation of the idea GLUE [2] and SuperGLUE [3] benchmarks, which focus on generalized assessment of tasks for understanding the language (NLU). Unlike sets like ruWorldTree and ruOpenBookQA (where questions are similar to MMLU format), which cover tests of the school curriculum and elementary knowledge, MMLU is designed to test professional knowledge in various fields. We provide public test version of MMLU in Russian for testing models.

## Dataset Description

### Data Fields

- `instruction` is a string containing instructions for the task and information about the requirements for the model output format;
- `inputs` is a dictionary that contains the following information:
    - `text` is the test question;
    - `option_a` is the option A;
    - `option_b` is the option B;
    - `option_c` is the option C;
    - `option_d` is the option D;
    - `subject` is the topic of the question (generalization of a group of subdomains by meaning);
- `outputs` is the result: can be one of the following string variables: "A", "B", "C", "D";
- `meta` is a dictionary containing meta information:
    - `id` is an integer indicating the index of the example;
    - `domain` is question subdomain.

### Data Instances

Below is an example from the dataset:

        "option_a": "0",

        "option_d": "30",
        "subject": "–ú–∞—Ç–µ–º–∞—Ç–∏–∫–∞"
    },
    "outputs": "A",
    "meta": {
        "id": 4,
        "domain": "abstract_algebra"
    }
}
```

### Data Splits

The test set contains`14012` hand-written translated examples of MMLU test. The few-shot train set `285` hand-written translated examples of MMLU dev.

### Prompts

For this task 5 prompts of varying difficulty were created. Example:

### Dataset Creation

The [original MMLU dataset](https://github.com/hendrycks/test) was translated using the following pipeline: 1) the test and dev part of MMLU was translated into Russian using automatic translation; 2) the translations were verified on the Yandex.Toloka platform; 3) the data that did not pass verification was manually validated and Russified. 

## Evaluation

### Metrics

The dataset is evaluated using Accuracy and, following the original methodology, is evaluated in the few-shot format with five shots.

### Human benchmark

According to the original article, for English test human-level accuracy varies:
"Unspecialized humans from Amazon Mechanical Turk obtain 34.5% accuracy on English test. Meanwhile, expert-level performance can be far higher. For example, real-world test-taker human accuracy at the 95th percentile is around 87% for US Medical Licensing Examinations, and these questions make up our ‚ÄúProfessional Medicine‚Äù task. If we take the 95th percentile human test-taker accuracy for exams that build up our test, and if we make an educated guess when such information is unavailable, we then estimate that expert-level accuracy is approximately 89.8%.".

Accuracy of the annotation on the test set is `84.4%`.

## Limitations

The questions relate to human knowledge relevant on January 1, 2020.
